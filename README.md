### Abstrach
The simple question answering over knowledge graph concerns answering single-relation questions
 by querying the facts in the knowledge graph. This task has drawn significant attention in recent years.
 However, there is a demand for a simple question dataset in Persian language to study open-domain simple question answering.
 In this paper, we present the first Persian single-relation question answering dataset and a model that uses knowledge
 graph as a source of knowledge to answer questions. We create the ParsSimpleQA dataset semi-automatically in two steps. First, we build
 single-relation question templates. Next, we
 automatically create simple questions and answers using templates, entities, and relations
 from Farsbase. To present the reliability of
 the presented dataset, we proposed a simple
 question-answering system that receives questions and uses deep learning and information
 retrieval techniques to extract information from
 questions to query knowledge graphs for answer generation. The experimental results presented in this paper show that the ParsSimpleQA dataset is promising for the Persian 
simple question-answering task.
